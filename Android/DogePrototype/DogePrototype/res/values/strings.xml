    <string name="disclaimer">Saviour relies on the community to help protect women and children. Upon receiving a distress signal, it searches for people within a range of 1km of the distress signal who are most likely to help you and who can reach you in the shortest amount of time. For this to work, it relies on an initial questionnaire that you will have to fill out only once. It does not take more than two minutes to set up, and since peoples lives may be dependent on the same, we request that you do so with complete honesty. None of the answers you share are displayed to the public and are used privately and internally on Saviours servers. </string>
